This project requires the following Python packages:

deepface – Face recognition and emotion detection using pre-trained models.

tensorflow – Core machine learning framework for running neural networks.

keras – High-level neural network API built on TensorFlow.

retina-face – Fast and accurate face detection for locating faces in images/video.

opencv-python – Image/video processing and webcam capture.

flask – Lightweight web framework (optional for web deployment).

flask-cors – Handles Cross-Origin Resource Sharing in Flask apps.

gdown – Downloads files from Google Drive (e.g., pre-trained models).

pandas – Data manipulation and storage for results.

rich – Pretty console output: colors, tables, and progress bars.

lightdsa – Utility library used internally for cryptography operations.

lightecc – Elliptic curve cryptography operations for DeepFace.

lightphe – Privacy-preserving encryption techniques.

astunparse – Converts Python AST back to readable code (used by TensorFlow).
